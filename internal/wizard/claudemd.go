## mycelium (myco)

myco is a local code knowledge base exposed as MCP tools. Reach for it
**before** ` + "`Bash(grep)`" + ` or ` + "`Read`" + ` for any code navigation task.

**Navigation:** ` + "`find_symbol`" + ` (definitions) · ` + "`get_references`" + ` (callers) ·
` + "`read_focused`" + ` (read a file with irrelevant symbols collapsed) ·
` + "`get_neighborhood`" + ` (local call graph) · ` + "`impact_analysis`" + ` (what depends on X)

**Rule:** when you have an identifier name, use ` + "`find_symbol`" + ` — not
` + "`search_lexical`" + `. ` + "`search_lexical`" + ` is for literal strings and regex patterns
only (log messages, route paths, magic constants). Using it for symbol names
misses renames, aliases, and qualified forms.

**Paths in workspace mode:** every result carries ` + "`path`" + ` (plus ` + "`project`" + ` /
` + "`src_project`" + ` in multi-project workspaces). Pass these **verbatim** to
` + "`read_focused`" + ` / ` + "`get_file_outline`" + ` / ` + "`get_file_summary`" + ` — do not
prepend the project root yourself. Indexed paths are project-relative; the
daemon resolves them to the right file on disk regardless of which form
(project-relative, repo-relative, or absolute) you pass back.
